During my Masters program, a coursework required us to listen in on a podcast by Edward Snowden, who was giving a talk at Simon Fraser University organized event. I almost stabbed as I felt it was irrelevant and I could always stream the recording later‚Ä¶but I had a rethink, I didn‚Äôt want money to waste and moreover, it was time to leave stabbing behind with my CU days."

A particular retweet caught my attention (yes, RTs are endorsements, argue with your keypad) from one OLUWADA-EMI-LOLA, whose location was British Columbia and I decided to take a stroll into the DM, nothing serious, no harm intended.\nIt took a few weeks before we finally met (someone was doing plenty shakara). She was writing exams at that time; and she too sabi book; so had to wait till she was done. Well the Yoruba Angel swag could not be resisted forever and the rest, as they say is history."
